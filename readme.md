# Backbone.js Wine Cellar Tutorial (with Node backend) #

This is based on [Backbone Wine-cellar example](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar) from Christophe Coenraets  but with Node.js as backend support

## Current Status ##

* Only part 1 is supported, with Node streaming wine list from static array (no database support)

## Set Up: ##

* activate part 1:

    `node app1.js`

* activate part 2:

    `node app2.js`
	
## Dependency ##
* `express` (tested on version 2.5.8)
* `jade` (tested on version 0.22.0) 
* `mysql` (tested on version 0.9.5)
